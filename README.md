After returning to content creation I noticed that I needed to extract text from my videos to upcycle my content into other formats such as slide decks and posts. 
I'd read about OpenAI whisper library so I quickly created this script for extracting text from a variety of file formats.
Cost of transcribing an 18 minutes long, English audio file in m4a format cost me 11 cents.
I then sent it over to OpenAI again and got it formatted with another prompt. All calls and prompts in this example can be seen in my code. 
The API keys are hidden away for obvious security reasons.
